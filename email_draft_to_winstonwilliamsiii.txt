Subject: BBBot — dialog & change summary (Nov 4, 2025)

Hi Winston,

Attached is the transcript and a short summary of the work I did in the BBBot
workspace during our session today. I could not send this directly via email
from here, so I saved the draft and the transcript to the repo. You can copy
this draft into your mail client and send it, or I can guide you through sending
it using a local mail client or an SMTP setup if you want.

Short summary (high level)
- Applied new styling modules and updated `streamlit_app.py` to use them.
  - Added `frontend/styles/colors.py` and `frontend/utils/styling.py`.
  - Main title and card/metric helpers implemented.
- yfinance handling and robustness improvements:
  - Made yfinance optional (the app will show a helpful message if it's not
    installed).
  - `get_yfinance_data` now batches downloads into small chunks to avoid
    Yahoo/yfinance limits and concatenates results.
  - Added `yfinance` to `requirements.txt`.
- Yahoo portfolio parsing and holdings extraction:
  - Added `frontend/utils/yahoo.py` with functions `fetch_portfolio_list`
    and `fetch_portfolio_tickers`.
  - Parsing uses embedded JSON when present, favors anchors pointing to
    `/quote/<SYMBOL>`, uses browser-like request headers, and falls back to
    conservative text/table extraction.
  - In the Streamlit sidebar, you can paste or upload tickers as a fallback
    if Yahoo blocks scraping or the page is client-rendered.
  - The sidebar now offers a "Validate selected tickers" button (best-effort
    check via yfinance for up to 20 tickers).
- UX improvements and safety checks added across the app.

Files created/edited (major)
- Added: `frontend/styles/colors.py` (color constants)
- Added: `frontend/utils/styling.py` (CSS and UI helper functions)
- Added: `frontend/utils/yahoo.py` (portfolio discovery + holdings extraction)
- Modified: `streamlit_app.py` (integrated styling, portfolio sidebar, yfinance
  batching/guard, holdings prefill + fallbacks)
- Updated: `requirements.txt` (added yfinance, requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml)

How to open and send
1) Open the transcript and draft files in your editor:
   - `/workspaces/BBBot/email_draft_to_winstonwilliamsiii.txt`
   - `/workspaces/BBBot/dialog_transcript.txt`

2) Copy the contents of the draft into your email client and attach the
   transcript file, then send to `winstonwilliamsiii@gmail.com`.

Optional: if you'd like me to prepare a short command-line snippet using
`mutt` or `sendmail` to send it from this machine (if configured), tell me and
I can prepare that command — I can't send emails directly from the environment
without credentials and your explicit approval.

Regards,
BBBot assistant
